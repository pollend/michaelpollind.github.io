      Worked with Professor Soangra and developed tools for physical therapy. This work focused on providing
      treatment through the use of and design of embedded devices. Provides non-invasive intervention methods as an alternative means of treatment.
      - Built custom board around an AVR microcontroller and flashed it with custom AVR code
      - Designed custom layouts to interface with embedded components and sensors
      - Designed a PCB in kicad and had the final board manufactured from a fab facility. This is a miniaturization of the orignal stack of boards.
      - Developed QT app for data collection for Mbient sensors.
