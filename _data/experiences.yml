      Worked with other mentors and built tasks for Google Code In. This includes tasks such as contributing
      to an existing Terasology Module, working on documentation, javadocs, and research. I worked with students and helped them complete tasks.
      This includes providing basic guidance for the Terasology code base and also refine a submitted task. The main goal of this is to introduce students to open source development.
