      Worked with other mentors and built tasks for Google Code In. This included tasks such as contributing
      to an existing Terasology Module, working on documentation, Javadocs, and research. I worked with students and helped them complete tasks.
      This included providing basic guidance for the Terasology code base and also refining a submitted task. The main goal of this was to introduce students to open source development.
      - Helped students learn the in and outs of open source development and also provided support when finishing tasks
      - Reviewed work submitted by a student (code review, documentation review, javadocs, etc...)
